## Usage

This describes a full deployment of Orion. For a more detailed guide, please see the [setup documentation](https://juno-fx.github.io/Orion-Documentation/installation/deployments/).

## Demo Setup

This is for demo purposes only. Please do not use this in production.

## Prerequisites

- [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing_devbox/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)
- [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker-install?tab=readme-ov-file#dockerdocker-install)
    - On linux, make sure to follow the post-installation steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

## Setup

The official Orion-Deployment repository contains the necessary files to deploy the demo version of Orion.

1. Clone the Orion-Deployment repository.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/juno-fx/Orion-Deployment.git
    ```

2. Change to the Orion-Deployment directory.

    ```shell
    cd Orion-Deployment
    ```

## Checkout Orion Deployment Version

The Orion-Deployment repository contains branches for each version of Orion that we have released. These are the
official Helm charts that we use to deploy Orion. To try out a specific version of Orion, you can checkout the
corresponding branch.

1. Get all deployment branches and checkout the branch for the version that you want to try.

    ```shell
    $ git fetch --all
    $ git --no-pager branch --all | grep remotes/origin/v
    remotes/origin/v1.0
    remotes/origin/v1.1
    remotes/origin/v1.2
    $ git checkout v1.2
    ```

2. Activate the devbox environment.

    ```shell
    devbox shell
    ```

## Configure Deployment

The deployment ships with a default `.values.yaml.example` file that provides all the necessary
configuration options. We need to copy this file and make any necessary changes.

1. Copy the default `.values.yaml.example` file.

    ```shell
    cp .values.yaml.example .values.yaml
    ```

2. The following fields are required
    * `registry`: Registry URL where the Juno images you loaded should be. If you do not know what this is, follow the guid [here](images.md).
    * `imagePullSecrets`: * If the registry requires credentials, the demo will create an `imagePullSecret` based on your own docker credentials called `juno-credentials`. To enable this, uncomment out the `imagePullSecrets` in the `.values.yaml` file.

## Launch Orion

Now that Orion is configured, we are ready to deploy it.

1. Run the following command to deploy Orion.

    ```shell
    make orion
    ```

   !!! info "Average Deployment Time"

        This process can take sometimes 2 - 5 minutes to complete depending on your local hardware.

   !!! success "Orion Ready"

        Orion will be ready for use once the deployment process is complete.

        ```
         ‚ùØ make orion

        ```

2. Access Orion at `https://dmo.localhost/`
3. The default credentials are email: `juno@juno-innovations.com` and password: `juno`.

## Launch Our First Workstation

Now that Orion is up and running, we can launch our first workstation.

1. Modify the `juno/workstation.yaml` file and update the tag, registry and repo that points to your Polaris image.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: juno-innovations.com/v2
   kind: Workstation
   metadata:
      name: user
   spec:
      registry: <YOUR REGISTRY>
      tag: <YOUR IMAGE TAG>
      repo: <YOUR IMAGE REPOSITORY>
      icon: "https://junovfx.com/dog.png"
      label: "User Workstation"
      group: "Production"
      cpu: "1"
      memory: "1Gi"
      mode: "interactive"
   ```

2. Apply the workstation template.
   ```shell
    kubectl apply -f juno/workstation.yaml
   ```

3. Access the kuiper dashboard at `https://dmo.localhost/workstations`
4. Click "Request" at the top left of the page.
5. If everything worked properly, you should see a workstation appear in the list of workstations.
6. Click "Launch" to start the workstation.
7. Wait for the workstation to show a Connect button.

### Clean Up

1. Delete the Orion deployment
```bash
make down
```
